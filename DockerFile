# STEP 1: Choose a base image.
# We use a Node.js LTS (Long Term Support) version that is 'slim'
# to keep the final image size small.
FROM node:20-slim

# STEP 2: Set the working directory inside the container.
# All subsequent instructions (COPY, RUN, CMD) will be executed
# relative to this directory inside the container.
WORKDIR /app

# STEP 3: Copy package.json and package-lock.json first.
# This step is crucial for Docker's layer caching.
# If these files don't change, Docker will use a cached layer for npm install,
# making subsequent builds much faster.
COPY package*.json ./

# STEP 4: Install Node.js dependencies.
# We use --production to only install dependencies needed for runtime,
# not development dependencies, further reducing image size.
RUN npm install --production

# STEP 5: Copy the rest of your application code into the container.
# The '.' refers to the current working directory on your host (where Dockerfile is),
# and the second '.' refers to the WORKDIR (/app) inside the container.
COPY . .

# STEP 6: Inform Docker that the container listens on port 8080.
# This is documentation and a convention for Cloud Run. It does not
# actually publish the port to the host system or outside world.
# Cloud Run will provide the actual PORT environment variable (which is 8080).
EXPOSE 8080

# STEP 7: Define the command to run your application when the container starts.
# We use the executable form for CMD, which is generally preferred.
# This assumes you have "start": "node src/index.js" in your package.json.
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
